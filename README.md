## Overview

TS-NX-Preset is a template repository for TypeScript monorepo projects powered by Nx. It provides a solid foundation for scaffolding scalable JavaScript/TypeScript development environments with built-in support for:

- Consistent code quality through ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Structured commit messages using Conventional Commits
- Automated Git hooks with Husky
- Simplified versioning and release management
- Comprehensive documentation templates

## Key Features

- **Project Initialization**: Tool to quickly rename and set up your own project from this template
- **Logging Library**: A flexible logging utility for consistent logging across projects
- **Workspace Preset**: Custom Nx generators for scaffolding standardized projects
- **Conventional Commits**: Enforced commit message standards
- **Automated Versioning**: Nx-powered versioning and release management

## Getting Started

### Create a New Project from Template

1. Click the "Use this template" button on the [ts-nx-preset GitHub repository](https://github.com/jinto-ag/ts-nx-preset) to create a new repository
2. Clone your new repository locally:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Initialize your project to rename the workspace and clean up template files:

   ```sh
   # Install dependencies first
   pnpm install

   # Initialize your project with a new name
   pnpm initialize your-project-name
   ```

### Working with the Workspace

```sh
# View the project dependency graph
pnpx nx graph

# Run tests across affected projects
pnpx nx affected:test
```

### Project Initialization

This workspace includes a dedicated initialization tool to help you quickly set up your own project:

```sh
# Initialize a new project using the TypeScript script directly
pnpx tsx tools/initialize.ts initialize my-project-name

# Use custom version number
pnpx tsx tools/initialize.ts initialize my-project-name --version 1.0.0

# Preview changes without applying them
pnpx tsx tools/initialize.ts initialize my-project-name --dry-run
```

This will:

- Rename the workspace from `ts-nx-preset` to your project name
- Update all references to the workspace name throughout the codebase
- Clean up template-specific files and scripts
- Stage and commit the changes to Git

### Using as a Template

This workspace is designed to be used as a template for creating new projects. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository from Template**:

   - Go to the [ts-nx-preset GitHub repository](https://github.com/jinto-ag/ts-nx-preset)
   - Click the "Use this template" button near the top of the page
   - Fill in your new repository details and create it
   - Clone your new repository locally

2. **Initialize Your Project**:
   Once you've cloned your repository, you can use one of the following methods to set up your project:

#### 1. Initialize a New Project (Recommended)

The initialize command renames the workspace and cleans up template-specific files:

```sh
# Initialize a new project (renames and cleans up template files)
pnpm initialize your-project-name
# or with other package managers
npm run initialize your-project-name
yarn initialize your-project-name

# To see what would be changed without making changes (dry run)
pnpm initialize:dry-run your-project-name
# or with other package managers
npm run initialize:dry-run your-project-name
yarn initialize:dry-run your-project-name

# Specify a custom version (default is 0.1.0)
pnpm initialize your-project-name --version 1.0.0
# or with other package managers
npm run initialize your-project-name -- --version 1.0.0
yarn initialize your-project-name --version 1.0.0
```

#### 2. Rename Only (Keep Template Files)

If you just want to rename the workspace without removing template files:

```sh
# Rename the workspace only
pnpm rename your-project-name
# or with other package managers
npm run rename your-project-name
yarn rename your-project-name

# To see what would be changed without making changes (dry run)
pnpm rename:dry-run your-project-name
# or with other package managers
npm run rename:dry-run your-project-name
yarn rename:dry-run your-project-name

# If you need to bypass workspace verification (use with caution)
pnpm rename:force your-project-name
# or with other package managers
npm run rename:force your-project-name
yarn rename:force your-project-name
```

Both options will update all references to `ts-nx-preset` in the codebase to your project name, including package names, import statements, and configuration files.

## Generate a library

```sh
pnpx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
pnpx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
pnpx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
pnpx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
pnpx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
pnpx nx sync:check
```
